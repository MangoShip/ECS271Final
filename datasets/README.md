# Weapons and similar handled objects: Sohas dataset (Small Objects Handled Similarly to a weapon)

Sohas datasets includes weapons and small objects that are handled similarly. It contains six different classes such 
as pistol, knife, bill, purse, smartphone and card. The classification images are obtained from the detection images 
in which the object's bounding box has been cut out. 

The txt file gives information about the experiment dataset partitions used in the article.
